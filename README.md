# Flight_delay_prediction
This project aims to tackle the issue of flight delays by employing supervised learning techniques to build predictive models. Flight delays are defined as instances where actual departure times exceed scheduled departure times by 30 minutes or more. These delays incur substantial costs for airlines, including labor, fuel, maintenance, and affect consumer satisfaction and business traveler productivity. The project's primary objectives include helping airlines reduce operational costs, enhance customer satisfaction, aiding airports in optimizing flight schedules for efficiency, and providing passengers with more accurate flight updates by predicting potential delays.

# Roles & Responsibilities:
Gather and aggregate data from multiple sources, including historical flight records, weather data, airport information, and other relevant datasets.
Clean, format, and preprocess the data to remove noise, handle missing values, and ensure consistency, making it ready for analysis.

Identify and create informative features from the data, such as time of day, day of the week, holidays, and airport congestion indicators, to improve the predictive model's accuracy.

Selected appropriate machine learning algorithms or predictive models and developed them using the preprocessed data, fine-tuning model parameters as needed.
Assess the performance of predictive models using relevant metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and conduct cross-validation to ensure robustness.

Implement the predictive model into a production environment, making it accessible to airlines, airports, and passengers for real-time or batch predictions.
Continuously monitor the model's performance in a production setting, retraining it as new data becomes available to maintain its accuracy and reliability.

Collaborate with stakeholders, providing clear and actionable insights derived from the model's predictions, and communicate findings through reports or presentations to support decision-making.
